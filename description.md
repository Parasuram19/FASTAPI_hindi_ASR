## Issues Encountered During Development 🚧

### 1. **Model Loading Complexity**
**Issue**: NeMo models are heavyweight and can take significant time to load, blocking the application startup.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Implemented async model initialization during server startup
- Added comprehensive error handling for model loading failures
- Created health check endpoint to verify model status

### 2. **Blocking I/O Operations**
**Issue**: Audio processing and model inference are CPU-intensive blocking operations that could freeze the FastAPI server.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Used ThreadPoolExecutor to run blocking operations in separate threads
- Implemented async wrappers around all blocking functions
- Maintained responsiveness of the API server during processing

### 3. **Memory Management**
**Issue**: Large audio files and model weights could cause memory issues.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added file size validation (50MB limit)
- Implemented duration limits (60 seconds max)
- Proper cleanup of temporary files and tensors
- Efficient audio preprocessing pipeline

### 4. **Audio Format Compatibility**
**Issue**: Different audio formats require different handling approaches.

**Solution Implemented**:

- Implemented automatic resampling to 16kHz
- Added format validation and conversion
- Supported multiple input formats with unified processing

## Components Not Fully Implemented ⚠️

### 1. **Advanced Language Model Integration**
**What's Missing**: Fine-tuned Hindi language models for domain-specific improvements.

**Limitation**: 
- Currently uses generic KenLM support
- No custom vocabulary adaptation
- Limited domain-specific optimization

**Reason**: 
- Requires additional training data and computational resources
- Generic models provide reasonable baseline performance
- Would need customer-specific domain data for optimization

### 2. **Real-time Streaming**
**What's Missing**: WebSocket-based real-time audio streaming and transcription.

**Limitation**:
- Currently supports only file-based batch processing
- No real-time audio feed processing
- No partial results during long audio processing

**Reason**:
- Increases system complexity significantly
- Requires additional buffering and chunking logic
- NeMo models are optimized for complete utterances rather than streaming

### 3. **Advanced Confidence Scoring**
**What's Missing**: Detailed confidence scores and uncertainty estimation.

**Limitation**:
- Basic CTC probability scores not exposed
- No word-level confidence metrics
- No quality assessment of transcriptions

**Reason**:
- Requires additional post-processing of model outputs
- Would need calibration on Hindi-specific datasets
- Current focus on accuracy over uncertainty quantification

### 4. **Multi-language Support**
**What's Missing**: Support for multiple Indian languages or code-mixed content.

**Limitation**:
- Currently Hindi-only
- No automatic language detection
- No support for English-Hindi code mixing

**Reason**:
- Each language requires separate trained models
- Code-mixing requires specialized training approaches
- Current scope focused on Hindi-only use cases

## How to Overcome Current Challenges 🚀

### 1. **Scaling for Production**
**Current Challenge**: Single model instance limits concurrent processing.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Implement model replicas with load balancing
- Use Redis/RabbitMQ for job queuing
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Horizontal scaling with multiple API instances

### 2. **Improving Accuracy**
**Current Challenge**: Generic model may not perform well on domain-specific audio.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Fine-tune models on domain-specific Hindi datasets
- Implement custom vocabulary adaptation
- Add pronunciation modeling for Indian English names
- Create ensemble models for improved robustness

### 3. **Real-time Processing**
**Current Challenge**: No streaming support for live audio.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Implement WebSocket endpoints for streaming
- Add audio chunking and buffering mechanisms
- Integrate with streaming-optimized models
- Implement partial result callbacks

### 4. **Enhanced Monitoring**
**Current Challenge**: Limited observability in production.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add Prometheus metrics collection
- Implement distributed tracing
- Create performance dashboards
- Add alert mechanisms for model degradation
